Boilerplate
-----------

A file 010.js with the necessary boilerplate has been created for you. This 
files contains the instructions and placeholders for your code.

Fill out the values of variables such that claim returns true;

At the end of each boilerplate you will see a common js export 
`modules.exports = ...`. This is there to aid the verifier, please don't modify
that section.

Note the `__` placeholders in the boilerplate. You should replace this with your own code.

Claims
------

Sometimes the challenge will ask you to make a claim. We have provided claim as 
a global function.

To make a claim write `claim(actual, expected)`, e.g.:

```js
claim(1 === 1, true);
```

Verification
------

When you are done, you must run:

$ {appname} verify 010.js
to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the 
lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
